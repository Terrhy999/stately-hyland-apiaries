I’ll walk you through “pulling” our Spring 2021 Honey from the hives at Stately Hyland Apiaries!

Spring 2021 is here at Stately Hyland Apiaries, and it was time to “pull” our honey.

> “Pull Honey” ~ _My Definition_
>
> Remove a Honey Super from a beehive at the precise time for extraction of honey.
>
> Stately Hyland Apiaries, Beekeeper

I took the opportunity of setting up a time lapse camera to document our labors of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">“Pulling Honey” at Stately Hyland Apiaries</span>, Spring 2021. (View the full video[ here](https://youtu.be/3Stqts62oe0))

Assisting me is my youngest son, who is 19 and also studying Beekeeping _(currently pursuing Penn State Beginning Beekeeping Online Course!)_ Not only is it exciting to share all my knowledge with my son, I have the added benefit of another set of eyes, hands and MUSCLES to help me with my more labor intensive tasks, like carrying; \_~ honey laden supers bursting with glistening light golden deliciousness ~ \_up to my car to bring to extract!

The video begins on a steamy, humid 92° morning. We are wearing our protective bee suits. The first and foremost important part of Beekeeping, is to have a plan and all your tools in place. That is what we are doing- setting up our[ Hive Butlers](https://hivebutler.com/products/hive-butler-hive-tote-and-lid)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>which will hold the loose honey frames for transport. We are ‘pulling’ honey first from my Medium Nuc Hive.

My Medium Nuc Hive with Peaked Decorative Roof

In this hive, I will manually brush bees off of the frames, back into the hive and put the frames inside of the Hive Butlers for transport. It is important to note, that this is NOT the preferred method of harvesting honey– but it will work for us on this day as the bees are in a strong nectar flow (are VERY busy foraging nectar). In times of dearth ~ (non nectar flow) the bees would try to retrieve that honey – meaning that they would not be easily “brushed” off of the frames. Luckily for us, they were amenable this day.

The second hive that we “pulled honey” from was my Medium hive, named the “Sunny Hive”. This hive has successfully overwintered since 2019 from a very strong swarm that came from “Sun Valley”. We took two medium boxes of honey from this hive.

A successfully overwintered hive since 2019 with a large Peaked Roof that opens, with storage for smoker and tools.

The third hive that we took from was called the “Borg Hive”. Aptly named in 2019 by our former State Apiarist Tim Schuler. My two beginning beekeeping hives were not faring well from the nucs that they had started from. As a result, and at the advice of the State Apiarist who was inspecting them, he put the two hives together and educated me saying \_“they are like the ‘Borg’- Assimilate or die.” \_Hence, the Borg Hive, another successful hive since 2019!

Borg Hive, Deep and Mediums successfully overwintered since 2019

Together with my son, we pulled two 9 frame mediums, one 5 frame medium, 4 individual deep frames for a total of **_132 pounds of honey _**in our 2021 Spring Season!

I created a fast motion video with captions explaining our movements. This blog article also fills in some of the blanks and adds explanations- as the video is almost 12 minutes long, this article will serve to ‘sum up’ our adventure.

EJH and I both wear our bee suits for safety. We have to remove very heavy boxes of honey frames \_(that can weigh almost 5 pounds each) \_for extraction. To do this, they are taken up the hill from the apiary to my car. I extract my honey with another beekeeper. I put individual frames of honey into our “Hive Butlers” that hold the dripping honey and keep the bees out. The other boxes need to have straggler bees ‘brushed’ off and transferred to a ‘bee free’ box.

We remove most of the bees from these boxes by way of a “Bee Escape”.

Bees Escape from this board but cannot navigate back into into it

It is a special board placed between the Honey Supers on top of the hive and the “Brood Boxes” below. The bees naturally migrate to the lower part of the hive during the cool nights to help warm the brood nest. As they navigate the “Bee Escape” they can exit down, but not go back up to the honey boxes again. _(Think of it as a bee turnstile!)_ As such, the honey boxes are nearly bee free and can be easily taken from the hives. We take out each individual frame and gently brush the bees to the front of the hive* (where they fly back in and get back to work again!)* The Honey Supers have 9 frames of honey that painstakingly have to be removed and brushed off.

You will see us using the “Smoker” to keep the bees calm _(busy drinking honey)_ while we remove their surplus honey. _Oh, and by the way, the JAZZY music is to keep you attending during the long 12 minute long video!_ As you can see in the video, some of the honey is “uncapped”. _(No wax cappings on the top of the honeycomb.)_ We test the honey for the precise humidity using a “Refractometer” and can assure that the honey was a precise 16% humidity, perfect for extracting!

Honey from our Apiary, newly extracted.

There is no doubt about it- there are bees flying everywhere during this process (and some even _crawling_ ~ _a daunting thought with loose pants cuffs, but I digress…_)

We remove the honey supers every time they are filled _(which could be three times a season!)_, extract them and return them to the hives. The alternative would be to stack them higher and higher on the hive and that would be unwieldy and difficult to manage. This is our beautifully light colored “Spring 2021 Honey” **_(my personal favorite!)_** We hope to get another Summer nectar flow and possibly even an Autumn flow again in September!

Stately Hyland Apiaries will have an abundance of honey and products this year that can be perused on our website “[StatelyHylandApiaries.Com](https://statelyhylandmanor.com/%e2%9a%9cstately-hyland-apiaries%e2%9a%9c-online-store-is-now-open-for-business/)“. They can also be found on our front fence, every (sunny) day!

Beekeeping is not glamorous by any means. It is hot, tedious, tenacious work! It truly is a “Labor of Love”… **_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">for the love of honey, and bees</span>_** ~ from our wonderful Marquette Hives at Stately Hyland Apiary! Thank you for your visit today!
