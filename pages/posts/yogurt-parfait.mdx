After fasting this morning, I saw that it had already passed 1:00 pm and I hadn't been reminded to eat by pangs of hunger yet. Fasting, at least for me, has decreased my hunger levels immensely and has allowed me to make unhurried consistent choices of what to eat for meals now. I realized that it was time to eat, but as I was not hungry, I decided on a light lunch, hence the yogurt parfait.
