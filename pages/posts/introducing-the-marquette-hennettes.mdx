Allow me to show you their undeniable cuteness!

Ok. They aren't that cute, or little anymore, they are actually 'teenage' hens, called “pullets”.

> [ pool-it ] noun

I procured these five Golden Wyandotte pullets from a local breeder from whom the original [Marquette Hens](https://statelyhylandmanor.com/introducing-the-marquette-hens/) were purchased in 2016! Thoughtfully delivered right to our coop!

_(Thank you Mitch!)🐔🤍_

🎂 These new 2022 hens hatched on March 8th and they are now one week shy of their 3 month birthday! They should start laying eggs in August!

🐔 <span className="underline">Golden Wyandotte Chicken</span>: Dual purpose breed (layer & meat chicken), brown eggs, with the feathers having gold flecks on black plumage.

For now, they are inside of the chicken run, 'cordoned' off from the matriarch chickens until they acclimate civilly towards each other. Tomorrow, I will allow them full access to the coop and run, but no playdates out of doors yet. They have to truly understand where they “live” and most especially, where they _sleep_. We don't want a repeat of this:

These adorable Buff Orpington Pullets (RIP 🦊 🍽 😭 ) couldn't find their “roost” inside of the coop. They instead looked to “roost” on the highest perch, which for them, was outside on the roof! They needed to learn where the roost was by sleeping _in_ the coop for a few nights before I let them out. I was hasty and wanted them to enjoy outdoor time without realizing my mistake. I had to lift them off of the roof and put them on the roosting bar myself in order for them to see where they should perch at night. ( - not unlike putting a toddler back to bed. Again. _Oh, and again…)_

Anyway, this post is about the new Marquette Goldy's!

Looking rather contented, albeit camera shy, four of the five new Marquette “Goldies” are relaxing peacefully after their transition to their new home. A bit caged unfortunately, but I will be giving them their indoor freedom (almost 300 square feet of luxury in their run) until they learn where to roost at night and then I will allow them out of doors. But I have to be ever vigilant! They are escape artists of the best sort. Not on purpose mind you, they are merely curious and like to fly and perch on fence posts and do not discern what side they fly back down to! One side contains green pastures and happy wanderings, but the other side contains _~ dogs!_ It is for this reason that I will have to fortify my fences on that side of the yard so that they do not accidentally wander- it's one thing to have them eating my neighbors daisy's, _it's another to have them eaten by a neighbor's pet!😨_

I am hoping that the 🧓 Matriarch Marquette Hens and the Goldy Marquette Pullets commune in peace, each knowing their place -_the Pecking Order- is real!_

Stay tuned for more Goldy and Matriarch Marquette Hens antics!
