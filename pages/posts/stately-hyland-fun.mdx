As I may have mentioned before, Stately Hyland Manor is neither a Manor nor Stately! It’s just a fun name a friend came up with for our first abode, an apartment- and the name stuck ever since! That didn’t stop me from using it – with reckless abandon! (Thanks to a spiffy new logo made with a great designer on “Fiverr”!)

But in reality, this was the original concept.

It was a WordPress website that I created in 2015 where I could share my pictures and blog posts ideas to my family and friends! Which I did!

I created posts about our cool “Aunt Frizzle” Field Trips _(my nieces and nephews christened me with that name- after Ms. Frizzle/Magic School Bus!)_, and where I shared my favorite household helpful (and “Save-a-Marriage”) <span className="line-through">_ie: shower cutoff valve- to stop us from arguing over the dripping shower head, but I digress…)_</span> items, and where showed off cool things on my eBay store and basically had fun just creating my own content.

A year into the site, we obtained chickens, which I aptly nicknamed “The Marquette Hens” as we live on Marquette Road and it sounded like MARKET hens, which I thought was catchy and fun! My posts started to include a lot about them!

Their escapades (and escapes!), my tips and tricks for Chicken Keeping and tons of pictures (and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7aY1qYlM9Eq2lwNOF2CpRg/playlists)) of them as well!

Then I started delving into the world of Beekeeping and **Stately Hyland Apiaries**, LLC was created.

As the years went on, the website got ‘bogged down’ and very slow and I encountered difficulties uploading media- pictures and video and then my creativity trickled to almost nothing. It was very discouraging wanting to create a new blog post but constantly re-encountering the problems of uploading pictures. Anyone who knows me, knows that I-like-to-take-many-pictures! _(And share them on my blog and in videos on my [Stately Hyland Manor You Tube Channel!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7aY1qYlM9Eq2lwNOF2CpRg) --shameless plug!)_

So here we are in 2022 and this is my new StatelyHylandManor.Com website and this is a before and after picture of our house.

This new website was created by my second son, TEH who made it especially for me because he wanted to help fix the situation. ♡ Almost one year later, he self taught his way to constructing this amazing site!

It is completely customized to my liking- which is clean and no frills _(and no banners, or ads or buttons to click or like!)_ I have an online store to sell my honey items, my blog posts to share and that is really all I ever wanted- and I got it!

It is still a work in progress and we’re trying to link back to my heritage blog posts and add more honey products. But it's all **<u>good</u>**. It's **<u>fun</u>**- it's **Stately Hyland ~ FUN!** Thank you as always, and enjoy the read!
