I've been asked to speak at a local, non profit Garden about being a Backyard Beekeeper, some myths (and myth-conceptions) and how honey is made.

I thought I would share what I plan to talk about with you.

Common Myths _(and Myth-conceptions!)_

- Beekeeping is easy, just put a box in your backyard.
- I can get honey and make a lot of money
- Bees sting all the time
- Bee swarms are dangerous
- Your neighbors will HATE your bees
- I need to create a Pollinator garden/I don't have enough plants
- Honey can't expire (HINT! This one is true!)

How to start your journey as a Beekeeper, before you begin

- Classes
- Bee Clubs
- Working with another person and/or a Mentor
- Legal Stuff
- Gear
- Hive
- Location
- Getting Bees

How Bees Work

- Beehive
- Bee types
- Lifecycle
- Beekeeping seasons

Honey!

- When bees produce honey
- How to get honey from the hive
- Resources

Finally, I will end with a 'honey tasting'- featuring our apiary's Light/Spring Honey and our Dark/Fall Honey!

This should be a SWEET gig, because anyone who knows me, knows that I LOVE to talk about Beekeeping! _(Stay tuned, I'll let you know how it turned out!)_
