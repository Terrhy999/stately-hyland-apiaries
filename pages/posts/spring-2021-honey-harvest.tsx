            Spring 2021 is here at Stately Hyland Apiaries, and it was time to
            “pull” our honey.

              “Pulling Honey” at Stately Hyland Apiaries

            <a href="https://youtu.be/3Stqts62oe0">here</a>) Assisting me, is my
            youngest son, who is 19 and also studying Beekeeping

            Not only is it exciting to share all my knowledge with my son, I
            have the added benefit of another set of eyes, hands and MUSCLES to
            help me with my more labor intensive tasks, like carrying;

            up to my car to bring to extract!
          </p>

            The video begins on a steamy, humid 92° morning. We are wearing our
            protective bee suits. The first and foremost important part of
            Beekeeping, is to have a plan and all your tools in place. That is
            what we are doing- setting up our
            <a href="https://hivebutler.com/products/hive-butler-hive-tote-and-lid">
              Hive Butlers
            </a>
            which will hold the loose honey frames for transport. We are
            &apos;pulling&apos; honey first from my Medium Nuc Hive.
          </p>
          <div className="flex justify-center">
            <Image src={image2} alt="Beehive #1" />
          </div>
          <p>
            In this hive, I will manually brush bees off of the frames, back
            into the hive and put the frames inside of the Hive Butlers for
            transport. It is important to note, that this is NOT the preferred
            method of harvesting honey - but it will work for us on this day as
            the bees are in a strong nectar flow (are VERY busy foraging
            nectar). In times of dearth ~ (non nectar flow) the bees would try
            to retrieve that honey - meaning that they would not be easily
            “brushed” off of the frames. Luckily for us, they were amenable this
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second hive that we “pulled honey” from was my Medium hive,
            named the “Sunny Hive”. This hive was successfully overwintered hive
            since 2019 from a very strong swarm that came from “Sun Valley”. We
            took two medium boxes of honey from this hive.
          </p>
          <div className="flex justify-center">
            <Image src={image3} alt="Beehive #2" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The third hive that we took from was called the “Borg Hive”. Aptly
            named in 2019 by our former State Apiarist Tim Schuler. My two
            beginning beekeeping hives were not faring well from the nucs that
            they had started from. As a result, and at the advice of the State
            Apiarist who was inspecting them, he put the two hives together and
            educated me saying
            <span
              className="italic
            "
            >
              “they are like the &apos;Borg&apos; - Assimilate or die.”
            </span>
            Hence, the Borg Hive, another successful hive since 2019!
          </p>

            Together with my son, we pulled two 9 frame mediums, one 5 frame
            medium, 4 individual deep frames for a total of
            <span className="font-bold"> 132 pounds of honey </span>
            in our 2021 Spring Season!
          </p>
          <p>
            I created a fast motion video with captioning explaining our
            movements. This blog article also fills in some of the blanks and
            adds explanations- as the video is almost 12 minutes long, this
            article will serve to &apos;sum up&apos; our adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            EJH and I both wear our bee suits for safety. We have to remove very
            heavy boxes of honey frames{" "}
            <span className="italic">
              (that can weigh almost 5 pounds each)
            </span>
            for extraction. To do this, they are taken up the hill from the
            apiary to my car. I extract my honey with another beekeeper. I put
            individual frames of honey into our “Hive Butlers” that hold the
            dripping honey and keep the bees out. The other boxes need to have
            straggler bees &apos;brushed&apos; off and transferred to a
            &apos;bee free&apos; box.
          </p>
          <p>
            We remove most of the bees from these boxes by way of a “Bee
            Escape”.
          </p>
          <div className="flex justify-center">
            <Image src={image5} alt="Bee Escape Board" />
          </div>
          <p>
            It is a special board placed between the Honey Supers on top of the
            hive and the “Brood Boxes” below. The bees naturally migrate to the
            lower part of the hive during the cool nights to help warm the brood
            nest. As they navigate the “Bee Escape” they can exit down, but not
            go back up to the honey boxes again.{" "}
            <span className="italic">(Think of it as a bee turnstile!)</span> As
            such, the honey boxes are nearly bee free and can be easily taken
            from the hives. We take out each individual frame and gently brush
            the bees to the front of the hive{" "}
            <span className="italic">
              (where they fly back in and get back to work again!)
            </span>{" "}
            The Honey Supers have 9 frames of honey that painstakingly have to
            be removed and brushed off.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will see us using the “Smoker” to keep the bees calm{" "}
            <span className="italic">(busy drinking honey)</span> while we
            remove their surplus honey.{" "}
            <span className="italic">
              Oh, and by the way, the JAZZY music is to keep you attending
              during the long 12 minute long video!
            </span>{" "}
            As you can see in the video, some of the honey is “uncapped”.{" "}
            <span className="italic">
              (No wax cappings on the top of the honeycomb.)
            </span>{" "}
            We test the honey for the precise humidity using a “Refractometer”
            and can assure that the honey was a precise 16% humidity, perfect
            for extracting!
          </p>
          <Image src={image6} alt="Bucket of extracted honey" />
          <p>
            There is no doubt about it- there are bees flying everywhere during
            this process (and some even crawling ~ a daunting thought with loose
            pants cuffs, but I digress…)
          </p>
          <p>
            We remove the honey supers every time they are filled (which could
            be three times a season!), extract them and return them to the
            hives. The alternative would be to stack them higher and higher on
            the hive and that would be unwieldy and difficult to manage. This is
            our beautifully light colored “Spring 2021 Honey” (my personal
            favorite!) We hope to get another Summer nectar flow and possibly
            even an Autumn flow again in September!
          </p>
          <p>
            Stately Hyland Apiaries will have an abundance of honey and products
            this year that can be perused on our website
            “StatelyHylandApiaries.Com“. They can also be found on our front
            fence, every (sunny) day!{" "}

          <p>
            Beekeeping is not glamorous by any means. It is hot, tedious,
            tenacious work! It truly is a “Labor of Love”… for the love of
            honey, and bees ~ from our wonderful Marquette Hives at Stately
            Hyland Apiary! Thank you for your visit today!
