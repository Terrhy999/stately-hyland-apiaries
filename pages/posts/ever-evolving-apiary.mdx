‚Ä¶at Stately Hyland Manor.

I thought I would quickly catch everyone up on the latest of Stately Hyland Apiaries, 2020.

**I've had a very successful year with 100% of my hives coming through winter alive!** I credit this to the thorough ‚ÄúPrecision Beekeeping‚Äù practices that I have learned from a Certified Master Beekeeper that I work with. This spring they lived to surge, swarm, and multiply yet again, as healthy bees are wont to do.

My 'double deep' and 'medium' hives produced copious amounts of honey on multiple nectar flows this past summer. Without the aid of County Fairs and Harvest Festivals to sell my honey at, I have been left with an abundance of jarred honey. This introduced my foray into E-Commerce - the ability to sell my honey products online from my website. Understanding the ins and outs of 'E-Commerce' was my challenge this summer, but now I am happy to share my new[ Shop](https://statelyhylandmanor.com/shop/) tab on the top of my webpage featuring a variety of bottled honey options and beeswax candles that I make home made and can mail to you!

I continue to share my honey and beeswax products in front of my house on my fence, almost every sunny day.

I successfully overwintered a smaller Eco Bee Hive with which I would have liked to have harvested ‚Äúcomb honey‚Äù, but alas, I left all of the comb and honey for the bees this year. Next year when they build an excess of honeycomb I will feel better about removing it and boxing it up. Comb honey is a special delicacy as the soft comb can be eaten along with the rich honey it contains. I am looking forward to next year's harvest of this.

In January I was able to attend the American Bee Federation üêù (ABF) Conference in Schaumburg, IL. I studied in various lectures and learned up to date information about bee health, new parasite invaders ([Tropilaelaps](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/MISC/BEES/Tropilaelaps.htm)), and even watched a presentation about the Asian Giant Hornet and learned not to be afraid of them as the media portrays them!

Stately Hyland Apiaries bee yard has newly included a 'medium nucleus' hive as well. Here is a picture of the ever evolving hives.

With the summer at an end, the hives and the yard are changing with the season. Here is a slideshow of the hives this Fall.

I continue to grow and learn in the world of bees and beekeeping. I have been fortunate to continue working outdoors in the fresh air and sunshine with the bees.

During some 'at home' months this past spring, I attended many free online lectures offered with **Penn State Extension** and watched their informative videos. Here is an example of ‚Äú[Sheet Mulching](https://extension.psu.edu/sheet-mulching-lawn-to-garden-bed-in-3-steps)‚Äú. You can find many helpful garden instructional courses and videos to watch during our at home winter months on their website alone. These and more Agricultural Extension videos are going to be my go-to binge watching this winter!

During our quarantine, I trained to become a NJ Permit Holder to control and stop the spread of the[ Spotted Lanternfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uin0GECoi4A&feature=youtu.be). This is an invasive 'plant hopper' that feeds voraciously on herbaceous plants, etc and will become a nuisance insect in our area most likely next summer. _(I hope you enjoyed your yard to it's fullest this year, because next year it is not going to be possible.) \_Here is a[ video](https://extension.psu.edu/how-to-remove-spotted-lanternfly-eggs) on how to look for egg masses in your yard this winter and destroy them early (which will help). **IT'S GROSS!** _~ And no, just because I'm certified in finding and removing them, I am NOT coming to your yard to do so!\_

Thanks for visiting Stately Hyland Apiaries, and please, by all means, peruse my new[ SHOP](https://statelyhylandmanor.com/shop/)!
