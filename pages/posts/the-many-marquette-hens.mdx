The new 'Goldys' really like their new[ feeders and waterer](https://youtu.be/j-_dqeAVxyI)!

The Matriarch Marquette Hens were a little dismayed to see their fancy new [feeders](https://rentacoop.com/collections/feeders/products/copy-of-10-pound-tall-single-port-chicken-feeder-by-rentacoop) and [waterers](https://rentacoop.com/collections/poultry-waterers/products/copy-of-1-gallon-auto-fill-cup-and-horizontal-nipple-chicken-waterer-by-rentacoop) being allocated to the new pullets this week.

Therefore, I decided to 'divide and conquer' and purchase a set of their own!

I chose this new waterer because most importantly, it is a _hanging waterer_. Hanging helps keep the waterer clean and inaccessible to vermin. Also, I prefer the “cup” waterer variety. You can [clearly see ](https://youtu.be/u_jORfgau8A)that chickens like to drink water from a basin (rather than a “nipple” - drop-at-a-time waterer.)

Ok. I am very much liking these new feeders. This one is metal and can hold a large capacity of feed. What I really needed is a feeder that actually _“feeds”_ and allows the chicken feed to settle down, not one that 'bins' the feed and it becomes inaccessible. The other one is working well so far, therefore I am confident that this one should work well also.

A little more about the Rent-a-Coop feeders and waterers that I just purchased. “Rent-a-Coop” is a brand name, and while they offer “rental services”, I'm not renting, just purchasing! Just for the record, it is complicated enough to keep chicken feed dry and their water clean, (unfrozen!) and inaccessible to vermin in the outdoor world, while inside of a dusty chicken coop! As such, I have been through <span className="underline">multiple types</span> of these products. Everything from the old fashioned galvanized gravity waterers and feeders, to huge refillable hanging feeders to now these hanging ones.

If there is wisdom to be shared about these nuances, it will be the following:

While it looked amazingly nostalgic, it leaked terribly. In the winter, it had to be set on a heater to keep it from freezing (which didn't work well) and it was very hard to keep it level and if it is not perfectly level, it leaks, like a sieve.

Chickens are dusty, from dust bathing, and therefore, everything in the chicken coop will become dusty. If you can keep your supplies off of the floor, and in a perfect world, suspended, it will cut down on the dust and usually prevent any contamination from possible vermin.

Any waterer with an open area will accumulate dirt, even in these drinking cup types. But, the flip side is that the chickens really _do prefer_ [dipping their beaks into the water](https://youtu.be/g7EfK-hqvPY) and drinking it down. They get sustenance from the “nipple” type drinker as well, (where they peck at the peg, releasing water droplets slowly) but certainly not drinking **satisfaction**. I feel I at least owe them that. So in the summer, they slurp from the cup type, but I will still use my nipple type waterer in the winter as it has an electric connection to keep it unfrozen. _(Chickens really can't slurp - I just made that up…)_

The hanging waterers also have the advantage of refilling easily with a jug or a hose.

I used to have to spend long hot hours hauling out the dirty near empty waterers, and then cleaning out the old gallon of free standing water (sometimes I found mosquito larvae in it!) as not only did it gather dust and dirt, it also grew algae from the sunlight. It was quite the chore to clean it thoroughly, add new water _and carry it back_ into the chicken run! These suspended waterers are much easier to refill and out of the sunlight, hence no more algae!

**<span className="underline">Chicken Feeder</span>**

I started with the old fashioned galvanized gravity chicken feeder.

2016 Marquette Pullets in their very tiny chicken run (not their current Palace!) with their shiny galvanized feeder. While nice and nostalgic, the food would get stuck and not refill. This was NOT a good feeder at all.

Gravity was never our friend. The chickens would peck at the food and either it would solidify from humidity and not 'fed' down into the hopper or it would feed down into the hopper quite easily and the chickens would 'beak it' _(swipe their beaks back and forth)_ and scatter all the feed to the floor resulting in waste and a mess. Unfortunately, both of these galvanized type waterers and feeders sat on the ground and therefore would then allow vermin to possibly sample from them.

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/_irr4LHQnJw) of a rat attempting to get into the Marquette Hen's Poultry Palace. An unfortunate fact is that rats are _always_ attracted to chicken coops. As ours is situated near a river, it is doubly likely that we would have attempted infestations. Fortunately, our chicken coop and run has been fortified and is rat proof. There was only one instance of a rat entering the run. (It was through a groundhog burrow that it continued into the chicken run.) That was for a short amount of time until I dispatched my Pest Management person on it! I know this because I have cameras inside of the run- I see everything! Also, the rats were tempted into my run because I used to throw chicken scratch on the ground- _<span className="underline">a practice I no longer participate in</span>._ (Also a neighbor likes to feed the waterfowl and unwittingly has attracted grain loving vermin to the hood.)

**Additional Feeders.**

I invested in the “Grand-Pa's Feeder” which is the large capacity treadle opening feeder. As a chicken's weight presses down on the treadle, the feeder opens, allowing them to feed while they are actively stepping on the lever. This is a great feeder! Except for the fact that it is noisy when it clunks open/shut _(they used to run over the treadle when they heard any 'people' noises and it would clunk, clunk, clunk likes kids stepping on a doorbell doormat (hey- dn't judge me- it was something I did for fun as a child!))_ Secondly, the feed also gets stuck in the hopper and I have to manually push the feed down for the chickens to be able to get at it. Not a good feeder for when we went away for a few days on vacation. Additionally, the birds have learned how to “beak” the food out of this feeder as well, making a mess, thereby making it an anti-vermin feeder moot. (Plus, the original version was quite expensive!)

So we are trying out the Rent-a-Coop version with anti-vermin opening and rain hood. So far so good, the chickens are sharing it and enjoying it.

I shall update you on the continued benefits of these waterers and feeders soon!
