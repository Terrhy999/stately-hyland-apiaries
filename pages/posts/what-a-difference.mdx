At Stately Hyland Manor **_<span className="underline">Gardens…</span>_**

Our deck, garden and front yard all evolved day by day this week. Allow me to take you on this visual tour.

Beautiful as always, but with signs of wear and tear- the burlap at the bottom of the chicken run tattered and torn, Japanese knotweed creeping into the yard, and less than abundant plant life.

We started this week out with a gift of Maidenhair Grasses from Master Gardener pals _(Master Gardeners are excellent plant sharers!)_ They now line the right side of the hill and behind the chicken run. [Video](https://youtu.be/I06BSkXzkfo)

The addition of burlap to the lower part of the chicken run allows some shade and privacy for the Marquette Hens. They also have perches, their food and water and plenty of places to scratch, dig and explore within. An early morning view of the newly installed burlap covering on the Chicken Run.

But I digress, onto the gardens progress…

Hidden from sight is a very clever design of mine for 'self watering pots.' I left the plants in their original plastic containers, but underneath I have nested them into quart and pint food storage containers. But first, I threaded some twine into the bottom of the plant container to act as a wick to bring the excess water up to the roots!

I have done this with all of my plants today. How do I know this works? Just look at the green potato vine in the window box pictures- I made that one first a few days ago. See how much bigger and brighter that plant is compared to the others? It is from having a constant supply of water on the bottom from which to wick from. I have used these designs before and have reaped the benefits! Simple, consistently watered plant pots!

I have installed these elevated [pot](https://www.oceanstatejoblot.com/misco-self-watering-resin-planter-8/product/263267) holders with Geraniums on the side of the chicken run. They also have the twine wick system I invented on the bottom of their original pots that I simply placed into the green decorative pots! I am looking forward to seeing how all of these pots fair during our very hot and possibly dry summer!

The next thing I did, which I do not have a picture of, was to get my dripping outdoor faucets repaired. This is saving my water along with my nerves from worry whether I turned the spigot off or not! I am now using exclusively [“crinkle” hoses](https://www.oceanstatejoblot.com/perfect-hose-deluxe-pro-full-size-garden-hose-100/product/136607), specifically, 100 foot ones that come with their own sprayers. These have proven invaluable here at Stately Hyland Manor~ _Gardens!_ Gone are the days of lugging heavy hoses around. These hoses expand and will allow me to water my new grasses at the <span className="underline">very bottom</span> of the hill as well as the side yards and even travel to the front driveway with their expanding dimensions! Once depleted of water, they 'crinkle up' to such a small size, I simply lay the hose in a flower pot to store it! What a gardening life saver they are to me.

This is my newest attempt at keeping the critters at bay and my garden within sight for continual care and watering. _<span className="underline">“Out of sight, out of mind”</span>_ has never been put to the test more than ever during very hot, blistering summers! Many of my plants have withered and died within one day of missed attention and watering. (Even my chickens do not need such daily attention as they always have adequate food, water, shelter and spacious nest boxes.) But hopefully, this planter on the deck will aid me in nurturing these new plants to fruition!

Additionally, I have <strike>cheated</strike> made summer plant pots easier by purchasing these ever blooming summer containers from our local nursery. They are _packed full \_of plants (which I do not know the name of) that manage to flower and flourish despite the most decadent neglect from me! Thank goodness that there is no <span className="underline">Association for the Prevention of Cruelty</span> towards \_Plants_ as they would have surely sought me out and committed me to years of contrition!

New burlap for the chicken run, twenty Maidenhair grasses planted, 6 new self watering Geranium pots, self watering chicken run window boxes, a hopefully critter free herb and tomato deck raised garden, additions of bountiful potted flowers pots, and weeded/mulched garden beds in the front of the house!

I am so happy that I was able to accomplish all of this (along with my in house helpers, gardeners and greenhouse purchases) during these cool sunny and rainy days this past week. I am looking forward to seeing how Stately Hyland Manor ~ Gardens grow this summer! (I hope you are too!)
