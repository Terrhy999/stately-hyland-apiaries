After chicken keeping since 2016, I have learned the good, the bad and the ugly of feeding my chickens certain treats. Sound wisdom can now be gathered from my experiences of each.

**Starting off:**

Who doesn't love sharing loving treats with their chickens? _(I suppose strictly speaking, not chickenless owners, but I digress..)_ They eagerly run up to you and crowd around your feet, stretching their heads at you, zealously awaiting what you have for them- it almost seems like love. Until it's not…

When will I ·never· learn. 🤦 [The Marquette Hennettes, lesson learned (again!)](https://youtu.be/TXvCsVq4ssk)

This is what results from hand feeding my newly arrived pullets mealworms just minutes before. The hand is the food, obviously this is the case to the chickens. Ugh. I can now ·never· idly dangle my hands within reach (and that includes jumping height) of a chicken without my fingers getting pecked. DO NOT hand feed your chickens. Hands=food=pecked. Lesson learned~ _(again. I made this mistake early on with my first chickens and it took years to outgrow it!)_

**Secondly:**

Simply put, everything in moderation.

Again, we love to share treats for that undying love and admiration from our hens. But I have found out the hard way (ugly) that sharing is not necessarily caring. I would drag in piles of green garden delight into the run for the chickens to feast on every morning when I was tidying their coop. I made them 'fermented grains'.

I gave them bountiful day old fruit and veg. They [gorged](https://youtu.be/X-sE3hAde0A) on it and loved every scratching moment of it.

It took me months until I found out the disservice I was doing to them and myself (no egg production). A friend of mine casually said to me that I was feeding my chickens _too much_ and that was why they weren't laying any eggs. Huh? It took a little more [research](https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/farming/nutrition-for-backyard-chicken-flocks/) to find out what sound advice that was. Chickens are raised nutritionally according to their ages: Pullets, Laying, Breeding and their feed adjusted accordingly with varying percentages of Protein, Calcium and Phosphorus. Simply put, I was DILUTING their nutritional needs by offering less nutritionally balanced alternatives. Now I only feed “treats” by the tablespoon and allow them to range in the yard in the afternoon (after they have eaten their feed in the mornings.) Lesson learned.

**Timing:**

The ugly. My chickens know when I step into their run (with my pail and my rake) that it is time for me to 'tidy up'. I often compare my chickens with “impatient hotel guests awaiting their rooms which are still being cleaned” as they pace and whine and get underfoot while I toil away. I wish to have the floor sifted - this I do by 'scooping' their litter into a bucket not unlike scooping kitty litter (of which I have no experience thank goodness because Chicken poop is nearly smell free and this is hardly a chore, more like exercise, but I digress…) But the chickens do get underfoot and as a result, I “bribe” them by throwing treats down the hill out of my work way. They scatter to the lower level, leaving me space to clean and peace and quiet work work in. Until they have (gobbled) finished everything up- then they are right back in my face, looking for repeat treats. This endeavors me to clean up with alacrity so as to finish timely and not be pestered any longer. Back to timing- now, whenever the chickens even SEE ME outside, they think it's tidying time and start their relentless whining for treats. Lesson learned- every time I show my face, they whine for treats!

**Placement:** \
Just like your parents not wanting you to eat food in your room should you ever over feed food on the chicken run floor. This _WILL_ attract vermin (see video) and depending on however good you are at keeping them at bay will result in whether they visit your interior run and coop at night. My run has a hardware cloth “apron” around its entirety. Video of a rat tenaciously trying to get into my run. That being said, a very overzealous groundhog attempted to make a den and burrowed 'under' my hardware cloth apron. We reconstructed the hardware cloth apron but apparently it was enough to allow a rat to finish the infiltration. I also have video of the rat inside of the run. An error that was rectified with one phone call to my Pest Management person. We re- reconstructed the hardware cloth, and the rat is no more. Spread just enough feed or treats for your chickens to consume in minutes, keep the food and water OFF of the floor and secure your chicken coop and run thoroughly with hardware cloth.

**Feeding fun:**

While introducing my new Marquette Hennettes to their new home, I found that I needed a diversionary tactic from the Matriarchy Marquette Hens (since 2016) that were getting overly curious of them. As such, the hanging treat feeder was employed.

**Rose petals!** 🥀

Particularly, wilted, dying rose petals. It ends up that the chickens like the rose petals and if they are already wilting, why not let them have at it! This time, I gathered some petals and some fresh growing tender stalk Japanese Knotweed and some grass and mushed it all together into a Suet Feeder that I hung in their run. As you can see from the video, they enjoyed pecking at it and ignored each other! [Treat time!](https://youtu.be/exr3zqOPNrc)

**Drinking:**

Those girls like to drink. I have strategically placed waterers around the property for when the hens are free ranging. Here is a short [birdbath](https://youtu.be/g7EfK-hqvPY) that they drink out of. The hens definitely prefer this kind of waterer as opposed to the 'nipple feed' waterer where they have to peck at it to get water droplets. They finish a one gallon dish of water in one day, which is too labor intensive (let alone cleaning it daily as well) to go on with, so I switched to a two gallon gravity feed [cup waterer](https://youtu.be/u_jORfgau8A) instead.
